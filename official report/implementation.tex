\paragraph{What Haskell library will we use ?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.1/docs/Control-Category.html}{the base library}
    \item the package \href{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/categories}{categories} which extends the base library
    \item the package \href{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/constrained-categories}{constrained-categories} which is more general than above libraries since we can use constraints on the types in the category.
    \item the package \href{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/subhask-0.1.1.0}{subhask} which is quite similar to constrained categories
    \item the package \href{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/free-categories}{free-categories} which is quite similar to Alexandre Popoff's \href{https://github.com/AlexPof/colubridae}{Colubridae}
