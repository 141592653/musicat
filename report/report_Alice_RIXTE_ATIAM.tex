\section{Presentation of PK-nets}
PK-nets\cite{PAAE2016} are the generalization of the 
\begin{defn}\textbf{Set} is the category where objects are the sets and morphisms are functions between sets.\end{defn}

\begin{defn} The \textbf{category of elements} $el(F)$ of a functor $F : \mathcal{C}\rightarrow \textbf{Set}$ is defined as follows :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item its objects are the pairs $(c,x)$ where $c$ is an object of $\mathcal{C}$ and $x\in F(c)$
        \item its morphisms $(c,x)\rightarrow (c',x')$ are morphisms $u : c\rightarrow c'$ such that $F(u)(x) = x'$
    \end{itemize}



\end{defn}


\subsection{Recover Tonnetz}
\paragraph{}
Now, what is the category of elements of the PLR-group action over \textbf{Set}? Let $S$ be the functor from the category PLR to the category \textbf{Set} such that $S$ associates to the only object of PLR a set $X$ of cardinality 24 and such that $S$ is a PLR-group action on $X$.

$el(S)$ is then a category with $24$ objects. One can use it as a $\Delta$ category in a PK-net. The transformation $\phi$ gives us the musical interpretation, of each transformation triads.

=> How to add more structure to eliminate arrow? Maybe take two generators



\begin{defn}
    The \textbf{free strict monoidal category} $ \Sigma (C)$ over a category $C$ is a monoidal category such that :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item objects of $\Sigma (C)$ are the list of objects of $C$
        \item for two objects $A = A_1,\dots,A_m$ and $B = B_1,\dots,B_n$ of $\Sigma (C)$, if $m = n$ then every list of morphisms $f_1,\dots,f_m$ such that $f_i$ is a morphism from $A_i$ to $B_i$ in $C$ is a morphism of $\Sigma(C)$ from $A$ to $B$
        \item The tensor product of two $\Sigma(C)$ objects is there concatenation as well as the tensor product of two morphisms.
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

What is the strict monoidal category freely generated by a group seen as a
one-object category $G$?

$\Sigma(G)$ contains a countable infinity of objects. There is no morphism between this objects and they can be considered independently as a cartesian power of $G$, where the empty list is $ G^0$ is the neutral element for the tensor product.
